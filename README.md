# How to work with this Repository

Add an virtual environment for python if not already done
python -m venv machineLearning-env

Activate the venv
On Windows, run:

machineLearning\Scripts\activate

On Unix or MacOS, run:

source machineLearning/bin/activate

install needed packages
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Update the requirements.txt file for new added packages
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

### Please note that some Notebooks could throw errors, especially test cases due to keras 3.0 in newer tensorflow versions
